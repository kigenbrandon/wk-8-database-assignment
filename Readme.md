# üè• Clinic Booking System - MySQL Project

## üìã Project Description

This project implements a full-featured **Clinic Booking System** using **MySQL**. The database supports managing:

- Patient records
- Doctor profiles
- Appointments between patients and doctors
- Medical records from each appointment
- Billing for services

It demonstrates the use of **relational database design** with real-world relationships (1-to-1, 1-to-many, many-to-many), and proper use of SQL constraints (PK, FK, NOT NULL, UNIQUE, ENUM, etc.).
